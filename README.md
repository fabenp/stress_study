**Motivation of this project**  

A survey of more than 10 000 people invetigated five main aspects of our lives: 

1. Healthy body, reflecting your fitness and healthy habits;
2. Healthy mind, indicating how well you embrace positive emotions;
3. Expertise, measuring the ability to grow your expertise and achieve something unique;
4. Connection, assessing the strength of your social network and your inclination to discover the world;
5. Meaning, evaluating your compassion, generosity and how much 'you are living the life of your dream'.

This was done with questions related to 23 attributes, among them: daily stress, daily shouting, lost vacation, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, daily steps, BMI range, sufficient salary, core circle, achievement, life  vision, time for passion, flow, sleep hours.
